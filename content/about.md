I am a literary historian interested in the literature, history, and philology
of the Middle East and South Asia.

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Asian and Middle Eastern
Studies at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, as well as core faculty in
Religious Studies and affiliate faculty in the Department of Cultural Studies &
Comparative Literature. Prior to joining UMN, I was the Farzaneh Family
Assistant Professor of Persian Language and Literature at the University of
Oklahoma. I have also taught at Université Paris Nanterre.

In addition to teaching, I previously worked to catalog Urdu and Persian
materials for the [Hill Museum & Manuscript Library](https://www.vhmml.org/) and the UCLA library's
Special Collections.

I received my PhD in Comparative Literature from the University of California,
Irvine (2017), where I also received my MA (2012), and completed a BA with
Honors in Community Studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz (2008).

My research stems from my lifelong obsession with language. I am especially
interested in the question of language in the Persianate world, the region
spanning much of Eurasia where Persian was once a lingua franca. My first book
on this topic, [*The Making of Persianate Modernity: Language and Literary
History between Iran and
India*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/making-of-persianate-modernity/A796FA74ABF9B0B6FAE1C81F60D75891),
was published with Cambridge University Press.

I work primarily in Persian, Arabic, and Urdu, but I'm also comfortable in
Hebrew and Spanish, have reading knowledge of French and Italian, and am working
on German and Turkish (among other languages).
